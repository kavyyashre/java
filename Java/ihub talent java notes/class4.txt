Comments in Java 
================
Comments are used for documentation purpose.

Comments are used to improve readability of our code.

It is highly recommanded to use comments in our regular programming.

Diagram: class4.1

Comments are ignored by the compiler. It means compiler won't compile the comments. Therefore comments will not display in output.

In java, we have two type of comments.

1) Single Line Comment 
-----------------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// comment here 

2) Multiple Line Comment 
------------------------
	It is used to comment multiple lines.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- comment here 
			-
		*/

ex:
---
//class declaration 
class Test
{

	//main method 
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{

		//variable declaration 
		int x = 10;

		//output stmt
		System.out.println(x);
	}
}

Interview Questions 
====================
Q) Is java platform dependent or independent?

Java consider as platform independent at byte level.
Java is also known as WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere).

Diagram: class4.2



Q) Is JVM platform dependent or independent?

JVM is platform dependent. 



Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM?

JDK 
----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.
JDK is a installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar), document generator (javadoc) and other tools needed for java application development.

JRE 
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Enviroment.
JRE is a part of JDK and it provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
----
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
JVM is a part of JRE and it is used to execute our program line by line procedure.

Project 
=======
It is a individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve perticular goal or aim.

Technically, A project is a collection of modules.

We have following list of modules.
ex:
	admin module 
	registration module 
	payment module 
	report generation module 
	and etc.

Every project contains two domains.

1) Technical Domain 
---------------------
	Technical domain describes using which language we developed our project.
	ex:
		Java

2) Functional Domain 
--------------------
	Functional domain describes state of a project.
	ex:
		Healthcare domain 
		Banking domain 
		ERP domain 
		Insuarance domain 
		and etc.

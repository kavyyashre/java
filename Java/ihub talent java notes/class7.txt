Identifiers
===========
A name in java is called identifier.

It can be variable name, method name, class name or label name.

ex:

class  Test
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int x = 10;

		System.out.println(x);
	}
}

Here Test, main, args and x are identifiers.


Rules to declare an identifiers
-------------------------------

Rule1:
-----
	Identifiers will accept following characters.
	ex:
		A-Z
		a-z
		0-9
		_
		$

Rule2:
------
	If we take other characters then we will get compile time error.
	ex:
		int  emp_id;  //valid 
		int  emp$alary; //valid 
		int  dept#no;  //invalid 

Rule3:
-----
	Every identifier is a case sensitive.
	ex:
		int  number;
		int  numBER; 

Rule4:
------
	We can't take reserved words as an identifier.
	ex:
		int  if; // invalid 
		int  else; // invalid 
		int  for; // invalid 

Rule5:
------
	Identifier must and should starts with alphabet,underscore or dollar symbol 
	but not with digit.
	ex:
		int  empId1 //valid 
		int  _abcd  //valid 
		int  $=20;  //valid 
		int  1abcd; //invalid 

Rule6:
------
	There is no length limit for an identifiers but it is not recommanded to 
	take more then 15 characters.


Reserved Words 
==============
There are some identifiers which are reserved to associate some functionality or meaning such type of identifiers are called reserved words.

Java supports 53 reserved words.

All reserved words we need to declare under lower case letters only. 

In java, Reserved words are divided into two types.

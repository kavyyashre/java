SDLC 
======
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle.

SDLC is a process adopt by IT industries to develop accurate and quality of software's.

There are six phases in SDLC.

1) Feasibility study 

2) Analysis 

3) Designing 

4) Coding 

5) Testing 

6) Delivery and Maintainence

1) Feasibility study 
--------------------
It is completely depends upon TELOS formulea.
ex:
	T - Technical Feasibility 
	E - Economical Feasibility 
	L - Legal Feasibility 
	O - Operational Feasibility 
	S - Schedule Feasibility

All the above information they will keep in a document called BDD.
BDD stands for Business Design Document. 



2) Analysis 
------------
In analysis phase, system analyst or product owner will involved.

They will seperate system requirements and software requirements.

They will keep above information in a document called SRS.

SRS stands for Software Requirement Specification.




3) Designing 
-------------
We have two types of designing.

1) High Level designing (HLD)
------------------------
In high level designing , we will design main/major modules.	
A manager is responsible to perform high level designing.


2) Low Level designing (LLD)
------------------------
In low level designing , we will design child/sub modules.
A team lead is responsible to perform low level designing.

All the above information they will keep in a document called PDD/TDD.
PDD stands for Product Design Document.
TDD stands for Technical Design Document.


4) Coding
-----------
In coding phase, developers will involved.

They are resposible to generate the build and later they perform unit testing.


5) Testing 
----------
In testing phase, Testing team / QA team will involved.

They will use one software component called STLC to remove all bugs from the projects.

They makes our project as bug free.


6) Delivery and Maintainence
----------------------------
Before delivery we perform UAT testing.

UAT stands for User Acceptance Testing.

It is classified into two types.

i) Alpha Testing 

ii) Beta Testing

Main Method 
===========
Our program contains main method or not. Either it is properly declared or not. It is not a responsibility of a compiler to check. It is a duty of a JVM to check for main method always at runtime. If JVM won't find main method then it will throw one runtime error called main method not found.

JVM always look for main with following signature.

signature:
----------
	public static void main(String[] args)

If we perform any changes in above signature then JVM will throw one runtime called main method not found.


Q) Explain main method in java?

public 
-------
	JVM wants to call main method from anywhere.

static
------
	JVM wants to call main method without using object reference.	

void 
-----
	Main method does not return anything to JVM.

main 
-----
	It is a identifier given to main method.

String[] args
----------
	It is a command line argument

We can perform following changes in main method.

1) Order of modifiers is not important. Incase of public static we can declare static public.
   ex:
	static public  void main(String[] args)


2) We can change String[] in following acceptable formats.
   ex:
	public static void main(String[] args)
	public static void main(String  []args)
	public static void main(String args[])	
  
3) We can replace args with any java valid identifier.
   ex:
	public static void main(String[] ihub)

4) We can replace String[] with var-arg parameter.
   ex:
	public static void main(String... args)

5) Main method will accept following modifiers.
   ex:
 	synchronized, strictfp and final.

Command Line Argument 
=====================
Arguments which are passing through command prompt such type of arguments are called command line arguments.

In command line arguments we need to pass our input values at runtime command.

ex:
	javac  Test.java

	java   Test  101  raja  M   1000.0
		      |    |    |    |_______ args[3]
		      |    |    |____________ args[2]
		      |    |_________________ args[1]
		      |______________________ args[0]

ex:
---
class Test
{
	public static  void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.println(args[0]);
		System.out.println(args[1]);
		System.out.println(args[2]);
		System.out.println(args[3]);
	}
}


Q) Write a java program to accept one name and display it?

class Test
{
	public static  void main(String[] args)
	{
		String name = args[0];
		System.out.println("Welcome :"+name);
	}
}

javac  Test.java
java   Test  JackMa 




Q) What is Literal?

A value which is assigned to a variable is called literal.

A value which is not change during the program execution is called literal.

ex:
	int   i  =  10;
	 |    |     |_____ value of variable / Literal 
	 |    |___________ variable name / identifier 
	 |________________ datatype / keyword
